Large Language Models (LLMs) sometimes produce hallucinated answers and one of the techniques to mitigate these hallucinations is by RAG. For an user query, RAG tends to retrieve the information from the provided source/information/data that is stored in a vector database. A vector database is the one that is a specialized database other than the traditional databases where vector data is stored.

Vector data is in the form of embeddings that captures the context and meaning of the objects. For example, think of a scenario where you would like to get custom responses from your AI application.
